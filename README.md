# Telecom-Churn-Rate
My visuals on Maven Telecommunications Customer churn analysis.

Churn rate is a metric critically important for companies whose customer pay on a recurring basis. If your typical customer doesn't stick around long enough for you to recoup your average Customer acquisition cost, the business is in trouble.

Recommendations to mitigate customer churn:
1. Improve customer service team
2. Revamp onboarding plan for new customers
3. Invest in more training for sales rep
4. Offer exclusive perks to existing customers
5. Ask for feedback at key moments and respond promptly

Analysis Process:
Downloaded the dataset from Maven Analytics, and filled in the blanks on Excel for easy use. Then, I Extracted, Transformed, and Loaded (ETL) with Power BI for interaction with visuals.
